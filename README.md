# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import numpy into the editor
### Step 2: 
Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the solution
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
distance=(l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2
result=round(math.sqrt(distance),2)
print(result)
```

### OUTPUT:
